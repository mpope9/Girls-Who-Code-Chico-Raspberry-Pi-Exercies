Exercise 6
-----------

This exercise may be a little bit trickier.  The purpose of this one
is to create a pattern of clicks on 2 buttons to light an LED.
Think of your pattern as a two digit lock.

-----------
Hints
-----------

1) I used a list to store the pattern that you want the user to inpupt,
   and another seperate array to store the user's input.

2) The method 'append()' for lists will be very helpful for this exercise.
   This method is how to add elements to a list.

3) You can compare lists just like normal variables in Python.

----------
BONUS
----------

Add a way to restart the guess, so the user can guess again.  'clear()' from
the list module will be helpful.
