Exercise5
---------

In this exercise you should be able to turn two LEDS off using two
buttons.  This exercise is much like the previous, except one
button controls two of the LEDS, and the other button controls the
other two.  So either zero lights, two lights, or four lights can be
on.

Bonus
---------
Have each button turn the LEDS that they control on and off,
alternatingly.  This means that 2 lights should be on at a time.
No more or less.  Good luck!
