Exercise 0
-----------

This exercise shows the basic things needed to use the Raspberry Pi.  
What is included is how to import the needed module in python, how 
to use the module, and how to set up the GPIO ports for use.

There is nothing to do, but this is a good place to reference if you
get stuck with later modules!

See the attached file, and use it as a "boilerplate" for later code.

Vocab
-------------

Module - Objects and methods that someone else wrote.

GPIO - It stands for "General Purpose Input Output" pins.  They read
       and send electrical signals.  You can damage the Pi through these
       pins, so be careful!
