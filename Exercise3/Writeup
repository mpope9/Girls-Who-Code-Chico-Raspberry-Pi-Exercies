Exercise 3
----------

In this exercise you should be able to turn two leds on and off
using one button.  So when one is on, the other is off.

Keep this one simple, there is not much more needed than the 
previous exercise!

----------
Hints
----------

1) You are going to need more than one outputPin!

2) gpio.setup can take a third argument for outputs, just like 
   it does for inputs!  Use 'inital=<True or False>' to 
   specify if the LED should start as on or off.
