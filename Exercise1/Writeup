Exercise 1
----------

Welcome to the first actual exercise!  If you've skipped Exercise 0 
you may have some troubles setting up this and future exercises.

The purpose of this exercise is to wire an LED to the Raspberry Pi,
and program it to flash once per second.

---------
Vocab
---------

LED - Light Emitting Diode.  A fancy, tiny light.

Current - Synonym for the flow of electrical energy. 

Resistor - Used to resist current from power sources.

Lead - The wires that electrical components have, the shorter one is 
       negative and the longer one is positive, for LEDS.

--------
Hints
--------

1) Use the 'time' module.  The 'sleep()' method may be useful.

2) Wire the positive lead of the LED on the same row on the breadboard as 
   power from the Pi,and the negative lead on the same line as the ground 
   from the Pi.

3) Use 'while True:' to loop for inifinity.

4) Rpio has 'HIGH' and 'LOW' to send on/off signals.

5) 'RPIO.setup' can take 3 arguments, but we only need 2 for this case.
   It can be used as follows: gpio.setup(<pin number>, RPIO.OUT)

6) To turn an LED on you should use RPIO.output(<pin number>, False)
   to turn an LED off, or RPIO.output(<pin number>, True) to turn it on.
