Exercise 2
-----------

In this exercise you are going to use some of the same ideas 
that were used in the last exercise, but you are going to add
a button to this one.  Everytime the button is clicked then the 
LED should turn on or off.

Hints
-----------

0) This is not a hint, do this.  Make 2 variables, 'inputPin' and
   'outputPin', and assign them the pin numbers from the Pi.  
   This will make you very less confused as you work!!

1) Use RPIO.input(<pin variable you made above>) to get the status 
   of an input or output pin!  Assigning it to a variable and
   checking the variable is probably an easy way to do this.

2) Look at the configuaration of your LED, and place the button in
   the same direction!  Remember, Long end is positive, Short end 
   is negative.

3) You can setup input pins the same way as you can setup output!
   Use 'pull_up_down=rpio.PUD_UP' as a third argument.  You
   also need to use the rpio.IN argument.

4) You dont need to use 'time' like you did in your last exercise.
